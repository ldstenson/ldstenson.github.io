		<div class="about">
			<p>
				My name is Lilliana (or Lillie) and I was born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin.
				After graduating from highschool, I spent 2 years studying computer science and creative writing at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, then transferred back home to the University of Wisconsin - Madison to study information science.
				I've played video games my whole life, and one of my earliest memories was watching a family member play <cite>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</cite> at my own request, and now I play games daily.
				Aside from gaming, in my free time I do arts and crafts, kayak, crochet, write fiction and creative nonfiction, feed my caffeine addiction, and collect uranium glass.
				Feel free to reach out via Instagram (and check out my Spotify since I have insanely good taste in music).
