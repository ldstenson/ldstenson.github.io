			<p> This game sparked my love for video games.
				Despite the clunky engine and mechanics, dated graphics, and the ability to crash any moment, <cite>Fallout: New Vegas</cite> makes up for it with its incredible story and the feeling that you, Courier 6, can really change the fate of the Mojave Wasteland long after The Great War reshapes the entire world.
				The game has a deep theme surrounding letting go of the past, through the main questline and the 3 main DLCs: <cite>Dead Money, Old World Blues,</cite> and <cite>Honest Hearts</cite>.
				Altogether, this game (is in my opinion) the best in the <cite>F</cite> series, with the other installments not even making it on to my list of favorite games.

			<h2><b>#2: <cite> Hollow Knight </cite></b></h2>

			<p>
				<cite>Hollow Knight</cite> is a Metroidvania game that I like just as much, if not more, than its predecessor itself: the <cite>Metroid</cite> series. You play as the Knight, the small but powerful protagonist that uses the void (and some really good movement abilities) to purge Hallownest of infection.
				<cite>Hollow Knight</cite> has a great soundtrack, a unique artstyle, and lore you can either glance at or dive into.
				The next game in the series <cite>Silksong</cite> releases soon, so I'm taking the time to start another playthrough.

			<h2><b>#3: <cite> Persona 4 Golden </cite></b></h2>

			<p style="text-align: center;"><small><cite>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 Golden</cite> box art, source: fallout.bethesda.net</small></p>
			<p>
				<cite>Persona 4 Golden</cite> is not only my favorite from the <cite>Persona</cite> series, but also just my favorite JRPG.
				The protagonist awakens to the power of his Persona and uses it to solve an ongoing mystery in the quaint town of Inaba with his group of close friends that grows as the game continues.
				The cast of characters is endearing and colorful, the story is both somewhat dark and heartwarming, and the soundtrack is stellar.

			<p>My modern <cite>Persona</cite> series rankings:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> <cite>Persona 4 Golden </cite></li>
					<li> <cite>Persona 5 Royal </cite></li>
					<li> <cite>Persona 3 Portable </cite></li>
