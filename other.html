				<p id="p1"> I tend to watch YouTube instead of streaming services or TV since you can find niche content, but I'm a few episodes in to <cite>The Last of Us</cite> and finishing it is all I can think about.
					Half because I'm a massive Pedro Pascal fan, but obviously the story, cinematography, and casting for both Joel and Ellie is excellent. I plan to play the game when it comes out on PC.

				<p id="p2"> In an effort to boost my Spotify Wrapped 2023 listening time, I've been using spotify for study music instead of YouTube, and I surprisingly got into the genre of Bossa Nova.
					Now, I use it anytime I need to relax. Bossa Nova is pretty jazz-adjcent and jazz is a decisive genre, so keep that in mind.
					My favorite so far has been <cite>O Pato</cite> by Ebony Loren.
